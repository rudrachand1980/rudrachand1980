## Variance Inflation factor to check collinearity b/n variables 
vif(model.car)
## vif>10 then there exists collinearity among all the variables 

## Added Variable plot to check correlation b/n variables and o/p variable
avPlots(model.car,id.n=2,id.cex=0.7)

## VIF and AV plot has given us an indication to delete "wt" variable
